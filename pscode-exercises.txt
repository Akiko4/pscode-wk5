// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input Number
remainder = Number % 2
if remainder == 2
	print "Even"
else
	print "Odd"
end if


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Initialize sum = 0
Initialize min_number = infinity
Initialize max_number = -infinity

for i = 1 to 5
    Read input_number
    sum = sum + input_number
    if input_number < min_number
        min_number = input_number
    end if
    if input_number > max_number
        max_number = input_number
    end if
end for

average = sum / 5

Print "Average of the five numbers:", average
Print "Smallest number:", min_number
Print "Largest number:", max_number
